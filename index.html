          <h1>Kaepernick's Kneel</h1>
          <p>During the 49ers' 2016 final preseason game, quarterback Colin Kaepernick knelt for the national anthem instead of taking a seat on the bench in protest of racial injustice and police brutality in America.</p>
          <p>He explained, <h4 id="k-quote"></h4></p>
          <p>Kaepernick's actions soon became a polarizing issue amongst the American public, often along racial divides.</p>
          <p>Several other athletes and NFL members also knelt for the anthem. The hashtag "#VeteransForKaepernick" was created. He was voted the most disliked member of the NFL in a 2016 poll. Several public figures condemned his actions and fans boycotted the NFL, leading to a drop in ratings. He also received death threats.</p>

          <p>In the days and weeks following, the public backlash has been swift. Those that have knelt, linked arms or sat have been labeled as unamerican, as traitors. They have been booed at games. NFL officials have recommended suspension for kneeling players. Vice President Pence, in his own staged protest, left a NFL game when players knelt. Even among those that publically supported the protests, there seems to be a common thread of disapproval about the form of protest involved.</p>
          
          <p>It's summed up in David Leonhardt's NYT opinion column, "The Choice Between Kneeling and Winning":</p>
          <p>In it, he contrasts Kaepernick's "angry" protest to the "smart" approach of the civil-rights movement, which included the March on Washington and MLK's famous "I have a dream" speech. He equates these forms of protest during the civil-rights era with the success of the passing of the Voting Rights Act a year later.</p>
          <p>As said in an Atlantic article on the subject,</p>
          <blockquote><h4>"Often attendant to the idea that protesting players are shooting themselves in the foot is the notion that in some other era, black protest proved to be a unifying force that altered the psychology of some critical mass of open-minded whites."</h4></blockquote>
          <p>This could not be further from the truth.</p>

       <p> Now, these protests are viewed much more positively – even held up as models of success. </p>
       <p> But during their time, in fact many Americans thought these demonstrations would hurt the advancement of civil rights.</p>
       <p> In a 1961 poll, <strong>57 percent</strong> of Americans said that they believed sit-ins and other demonstrations by African-Americans would hurt their chances of being integrated in the South. </p>
       <p> These numbers sound strikingly similar to the <strong>55 percent</strong> of Americans that said the Black Lives Matter movement distracts from real issues of racial discrimination in a September poll.</p>

        <h1> Does it matter? </h1>
        <p> So what do these patterns mean for the future, and for the movement that Colin Kaepernick sparked when he took a knee last year?</p>
        <p> When looking at polling data of attitudes towards protests taken at the time of the protests, it's important to realize that they reflect the attitudes of that time.</p>
        <p> Attitudes change, and while civil rights protestors may not connect with the hearts of American people during their time, they connect with the hearts of those to come.</p>
        <p> When people protest, they have their eyes set on the future. And they should continue to do so.</p>
